The datasetter allows you to generate HTML files, their corresponding screenshots and a JSON file with the labeled HTML elements. This way you can train supervised and non-supervised models.

In this dataset you will find a folder with CSS, js, HTML files, image folders and JSON files. The html directory has html files rw prefix with the name (rw_0.html, row_1.html,.., row_n.html). Inside the CSS folder, the Bootstrap distribution file with the web page's color palette and another file with the necessary CSS rules for the sidebar and extra required styling.

If you have a Chrome or Chromium browser installed you can skip this step. Otherwise\n"," you can download either a setup or a zip file with the software. In this case we recommend downloading\n"," Chromium from [this builds website](https://chromium.woolyss.com/). You should select \"Archive\" (Zip folder) or Installer.\n","2. Next you have to download the Chrome Driver from [here](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/). **Make sure\n"," you have SAME VERSIONS for the driver and the browser**. Once downloaded the driver, extract and put the file in your browser's executable folder. If you installed Chrome the path could be `C:/Program Files/Google/Chrome/Application`.\n","\n"," You can always check the official [documentation of Selenium](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/ChromeDriver)\n","\n","# Installation\n","Simply git clone this repository or download the zip folder: \n","```bash\n","git clone https://github.com/agsoto/webgenerator.git\n","cd webgenerator\n","```\n","Then install the dependencies\n","```bash\n","pip install -r requirements.txt\n","```\n","Since screen capturing feature depends on Selenium Driver, you should add the path to the system's enviroment variables. Look how to [set your enviroment variables](https://zwbetz.com/download-chromedriver-binary-and-add-to-your-path-for-automated-functional-testing/) on Windows and Mac. Or if your'e using linux you can create a symbolic link: \n","`ln -s path-to-executable-driver chromedriver`.\n","\n","However if you don't want to add an eviroment variable, when using the class ScreenShutter, you can set the path to the driver this way:\n","```bash\n","ScreenShutter(driver_path=\"path-to-executable-driver\")\n","```\n","This optional parameter could be set as it appears in [line 18 of Main.py](https://github.com/agsoto/webgenerator/blob/master/Main.py#L18) file.\n","\n","    \n","## Execution\n","There's a code example of the use of the generator in the [Main.py](https://github.com/agsoto/webgenerator/blob/master/Main.py) file.
